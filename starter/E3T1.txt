# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

I was unable to get any findings via GuardDuty.  Research via the Udacity
knowledge base (mentor help) and found this to be a common issue 
(https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/784769).  I've included screenshots
for both GuardDuty (/w no findings) and the SSH brute force attack via hydra.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

I found the documentation for the AWS guard duty SSH brute force page 
via https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_finding-types-ec2.html#unauthorizedaccess-ec2-sshbruteforce.

Under normal operation Guard Duty gets its source of data from the VPC Flow 
Logs (its a UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce attack).  It monitors traffic 
specifically on port 22 (SSH configured on other ports is not monitored).
