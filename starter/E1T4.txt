Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload
data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor 
practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The public subnet has the web service instance, rather then the private subnet  
which currently has nothing.  The web service instance can be moved to the 
private subnet (the application load balancer is forwarding traffic
to the web service instance).

# Poor practice 2

Given the application load balancer (ALB) is forwarding HTTP requests to the
web server instance, the security group (WebAppSG) is overly permissive.  it
currently has ingress rules setup for all (-1) on 0.0.0.0/0.
