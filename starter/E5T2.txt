# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

Snyk:  https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/

### Example vulnerability

Non-Encrypted root block device [SNYK-CC-TF-53]
EC2 API termination protection is not enabled [SNYK-CC-AWS-426]

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

ECR: https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/
Inspector: https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/

### Example vulnerability

Inspector can be used (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-set-up-continuous-golden-ami-vulnerability-assessments-with-amazon-inspector/)
to scan for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), disabled encryption, unencrypted volumes, and overly permissive security rules.

ECR can be used to scan containers (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning.html)

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

AWS Config: https://aws.amazon.com/config/

### Example vulnerability

s3-bucket-versioning-enabled - If versioning is enabled for your S3 buckets.

s3-default-encryption-kms - If the Amazon S3 bucket is not encrypted with AWS KMS key.
