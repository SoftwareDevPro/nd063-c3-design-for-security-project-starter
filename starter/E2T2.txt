The EC2 instance (Web Service Instance - C3) has a public facing IP address. 
It is behind an application load balancer.  It can be remediated by moving 
the web service instance to the private subnet.

All ports for the Web Service Instance are open on the ingress and egress side 
(0.0.0.0/0), it can be remediated by modifying ACL (access control lists) or the
security groups (WebAppSG)
