# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh 
brute force attack from the internet.

1. Remove access on port 22, and use AWS Systems Manager as an alternative for 
   shell access to the EC2 instance.
2. Creation a jump box (Bastion Host), and reconfigure the security group (SG) 
   to only allow SSH access from the host.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the 
  even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented 
  access to sensitive data.

If API credentials are compromised, encryption can be used.  Thus even if the
file is downloaded, they won't be able to read it (as it would be encrypted).
